# Rehabilitation_app
This is my Final degree project (TFG) made for the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF).

This Unity project uses [this](https://github.com/joangmm/starting_point) repository as a **starting point**.

Special thanks to my supervisor: **Pedro Omedas Morera**. Author: **Joan Garcia Marty**.


Below, you will find a link to a video of the application in its final state, after having modified it taking into account the user feedback.
